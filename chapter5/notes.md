#### Code quality enforcement
- Standardizing our code's format by using formatting tools and linters
- Reducing bugs and vulnerabilities in our code by introducing static code analysis tools
- Automating quality checks before pushing code to a repository
- Organizing our code and documenting it for clearer usage and reuse
- Creating a culture of learning through code reviews.

##### Constraints on development

- The focus on any company should be on trying to increase the throughput of the constrain
and protecting its time from being wasted at that stage. This is known as elevating the constraint.
