#### Accountability and handling failure

Mistakes are going to happen. They happen to every person and every team. Companies will often see a mistake
as a failure in process or people and will add additional constraints and textend deployment timelines
to be sure there aren't any bugs or problems. Teams will be created to ensure the quality of a product
before it is shipped, often leading to longer and longer lead times.
