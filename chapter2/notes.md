### Introducing continuous integration
You will never know all of the use cases.
Create README.md.

    Instructions on how to run the software
    Configurations in your environment to run the software
    Known dependencies
    Troubleshooting information
    Common use case and example of using the sofware
    Software milestone

- A greenfield project
  
      Create a makefile.
      Standarization and documentation, you establish a guide on how to work on this product. Standarization our system
      allows other to contribute it.

- The assembly line
 
      Most companies do not need artisanal software, they need predicitibility and reliability.
      Continous integration pipeline.
      Github actions.
      Henry Ford principles:
      - Place the tools and people in the order of operation
      - Optimize the flow for each station of work
      - Automate the line to move the product being assembled

- Warehouse

      The proximity of resources and distribution networks are esential to modern production as well.
      Instead of relying on the location of natural resources, now companies will build warehouses to store
      their materails until they can get around to processing them. When a product is completed, it then goes
      to another warehouse until it is needed by a customer. These warehouses algo go by another, more generic
      name: repositories.

      Repositories are locations to store things. 
  

- Material

      We have the executable file, to share with other members of the team..



- Summary

      The code repository is the start of your pipeline where all codes lives.
      Use scripts and tools to make environments uniform for all developers and systems.
      Document everything in your code base to make developers productive from day one.
      Automate all tasks associated with your code.
